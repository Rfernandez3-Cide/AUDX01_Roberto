📁 Java File Copier

This is a simple Java application that allows users to copy files (either binary or character/text files) from one folder to another. The program prompts the user to input the source and destination file names, and determines whether to use stream-based or non-stream-based copying based on the file type.

🧾 Features

✅ Supports copying binary files (e.g., images, executables).

✅ Supports copying text/character files.

✅ Automatically chooses between stream and non-stream methods.

✅ Uses both approaches (stream and non-stream) as required by the exercise.

📌 Requirements

Java JDK 8 or higher

A terminal or IDE to run the program

🚀 How It Works

The program asks the user for:

Source file name (including path if needed)

Destination file name (including path)

File type: binary or text

Based on the user’s input, it:

Uses streams (InputStream/OutputStream) for binary files.

Uses character-based readers/writers (FileReader/FileWriter) for text files.

It performs the copy operation and notifies the user of success or failure.

🛠️ Code Structure

The main logic is inside a single Java class. The core methods include:

copyBinaryFileWithStreams(String source, String destination)

copyTextFileWithReaders(String source, String destination)

Both stream and non-stream methods are demonstrated as required.

📄 Example Usage
Enter source file path: data/image.png
Enter destination file path: backup/image_copy.png
Is this a binary file? (yes/no): yes
Copying file using streams...
File copied successfully!

⚠️ Notes

Make sure the source file exists before running the program.

The destination folder must have write permissions.

Binary files should be copied using streams to avoid corruption.

📚 Learning Objectives

This exercise helps practice:

Working with file I/O in Java

Understanding stream-based vs non-stream-based file operations
